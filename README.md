# OpenMRS ArdenReminders Module

## Description

OMOD module for [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/). Provides very basic decision support as Clinical Reminders on the 
Patient Dashboard, generated from [Arden Medical Logic Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arden_syntax) (version 
2.5) through [Arden2ByteCode](http://plri.github.io/arden2bytecode/).

## Building from Source

You will need to have Java 1.6+ and Maven 2.x+ installed.  Use the command 'mvn package' to compile and package the 
module. The `.omod` file will be in the `omod/target` folder.

Alternatively you can add the snippet provided on the [Creating Modules](https://wiki.openmrs.org/x/cAEr) page to your 
`omod/pom.xml` and use the mvn command:

    mvn package -P deploy-web -D deploy.path="../../openmrs-1.8.x/webapp/src/main/webapp"

It will allow you to deploy any changes to your web resources such as `.jsp` or `.js` files without re-installing the 
module. The `deploy.path` is used to specify the location of your OpenMRS installation.

## Installation

1. Build the module to produce the `.omod` file.
2. Use the OpenMRS Administration > Manage Modules screen to upload and install the `.omod` file.

If uploads are not allowed from the web (changable via a runtime property), you can drop the `.omod` into the 
`~/.OpenMRS/modules folder`.  (Where `~/.OpenMRS` is assumed to be the Application Data Directory that your OpenMRS 
instance is using.)  After placing the file there simply restart OpenMRS/tomcat and the module will be loaded and 
started.

## Usage

After installing the .omod file, look for an Arden Reminders section on OpenMRS's Advanced Administration page to manage
your Medical Logic Modules. Medical Logic Modules for which "Evoke" is enabled will be run when viewing the Patient
Dashboard and any messages generated by Arden `WRITE` statements will be reported in the Clinical Reminders widget.
